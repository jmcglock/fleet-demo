# Goodbye ArgoCD, Hello Fleet?
Fleet is a container management and deployment engine designed to offer users more control on the local cluster and constant monitoring through GitOps.
## Read more about Fleet [here](https://fleet.rancher.io/)
My homelab runs on Harvester which heavily utilizes fleet. I have several kubernetes cluster running on top of Harvester. Why not make the switch from ArgoCD to Fleet?

## What's in this repo?
This repo contains some demo manifests and helm charts that I am using to test out Fleet. I will be updating this repo as I learn more about Fleet. Public learning is always fun!

#### A small note. 
I obviously also have a private repo for fleet. This repo is just for public learning purposes and is largely the same as my kubernetes repo.
